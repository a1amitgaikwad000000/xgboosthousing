# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction using XGBoost

A **Machine Learning web application** built with **Streamlit** that predicts California house prices based on housing features such as median income, house age, population, and location.
The model is trained using the California Housing dataset and an XGBoost regression algorithm.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to estimate real estate prices.
Users can enter housing details through a simple web interface, and the trained model will predict the estimated house price.

The application is designed with a **clean interactive interface using Streamlit**, making it easy for users to test predictions in real time.
